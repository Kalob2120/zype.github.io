In a [previous tutorial](http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/11/25/create-roku-app-on-zype/),
we described how to create a Roku App using the Zype Platform. In this tutorial,
we will walk through how to develop a Roku app using the Zype SDK and testing it locally.

To complete this tutorial, we expect that you have knowledge of git and GitHub. You
should have some knowledge of programming, but do not have to have prior experience
with the [BrightScript language](http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/BrightScript+Language+Reference)
that Roku uses to create Roku Channels (our SDK does all the heavy lifting for you!).

Also, you will need to have a Roku available to test out your app and a developer account with Roku to publish the app. [Register here](https://www.roku.com/developer) for a Roku developer account.

**Step 1**

You should have already created a Roku App on the Zype Platform. If you need help
creating a Roku App from the Zype Platform, please read our [previous tutorial](http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/11/25/create-roku-app-on-zype/).

**Step 2**

Now that you have a Roku App created on the Zype Platform, you will need to set up
your Roku to be in developer mode. This will allow you to test out your app before you publish it.

To set up your Roku for developer mode, navigate to the home screen of your Roku
and with your Roku remote control click the following: Home 3x, Up 2x, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right.

You will be prompted to enter a developer password for the Roku device and then follow
instructions to restart the device. Record the password that you enter because it
will be used to load your channel in development mode.

You will need to also record your Roku Player's IP address. In your Roku, go to
Settings > Network.

**Step 3**

Now that your Roku is set up for developer mode and you have recorded your Developer Password
and your Roku Player's IP address, you are set to grab the Zype Roku SDK from our GitHub account.

Clone the repo [here](https://github.com/zype/zype-roku).

**Step 4**

Once you have the code on your computer, you will need to do 3 things to customize the Roku app
for your own app.

First, you need to open the app.mk file and set the ROKU_DEV_TARGET to your Roku Player's IP
address and set the DEVPASSWORD to your Developer Password.

Second, you will need to change the hard coded keys/initialization variables that are
located in source/objects/config.brs. You will be able to find your api_key, app_key, and
player_key in the Zype Platform.

Third, you need to make sure that the APPNAME in the Makefile matches the name of the Roku App's directory that you cloned into. If you do not change anything from cloning, the Makefile and the
directory name should both be zype-roku.

**Step 5**

Now, its time to run your Roku App in the developer environment. Navigate to the Roku app's directory in your terminal and run:

<pre><code>$ make install</code></pre>

This will build the app onto your local Roku App. Once the build is finished, your will automatically be loaded onto your Roku. Test to make sure everything works appropriately.

Now that your Roku app is built, you will need to publish the app to the Roku Channel store.
