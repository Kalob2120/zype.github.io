If you've been busy adding video content to the [Zype Platform](http://admin.zype.com) and creating playlists, you might be at the point where you've got a few pages of each. To help you better manage your content, we've added a set of filters to the videos and playlists pages:

The search filters button let's you select as many parameters for your search as you'd like. Each button has a dropdown selector you can use to select a value to search by. The default search options are "Active" (whether or not the video is marked as active) and each of the categories you've created for your site. You can create and manage your categories [here.](https://admin.zype.com/categories)

Once you've selected all of the filters you want to use, click the search button to see the results.

You can search by entering a search term, using the filters or both!

If the search filters button is greyed out, that's because you don't have any videos or playlists yet.
