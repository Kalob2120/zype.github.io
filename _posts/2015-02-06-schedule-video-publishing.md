You can publish a video two different ways on the Zype Platform. You can either
set a video to be active right away or you can set a video to be active in a future date.
Once a video is active, it is published and can be viewed by your end users.

**Setting a Video as Active Right Away**

If you want to publish your video via a "set and forget" method, navigate to your video
edit page and turn active on.

Once your video is active, it will be able to be viewed.

**Scheduling a Video to become Active**

If you want to schedule when your video is published (and thus, active), you
can set the "Start at" and "Expire at" dates in your edit video page.

Your video will be made active at the specified start at time and will be made inactive
at the specified expire at time. If you do not want the video to become inactive in
the future, you can leave the expire at field blank!
