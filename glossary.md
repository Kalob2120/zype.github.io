#### HLS:
HTTP Live Streaming is an HTTP-based media streaming communications protocol implemented by Apple Inc. as part of their QuickTime, Safari, OS X, and iOS software. It works by breaking the overall stream into a sequence of small HTTP-based file downloads, each download loading one short chunk of an overall potentially unbounded transport stream. As the stream is played, the client may select from a number of different alternate streams containing the same material encoded at a variety of data rates, allowing the streaming session to adapt to the available data rate. At the start of the streaming session, it downloads an extended M3U playlist containing the metadata for the various sub-streams which are available.

#### Zobjects:
Zobjects offer Admins a way to model information in an object oriented way. In order to use zobjects, you'll first need to create a zobject type with the fields you want to use to store information. Some example zobject types include: Actor, Director, Carousel Item, Bonus Feature Video.
