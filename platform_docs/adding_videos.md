##Adding Videos to the Zype Platform
You can add videos to your Zype Library in two different ways. The first way is to upload
videos directly to the Zype Platform. The second way is to import videos from a third-party source such as YouTube, Hulu, or Crunchyroll. Videos that are uploaded will have a Zype
Video Source, all other videos will have a video source from the respected third-party.

## Uploading Videos to the Zype Platform from the Web
The easiest way to add a video to your video library is to upload a video to the Zype Platform.

We support many popular media formats such as: 3GP, AAC, AVI, FLV, MP4 and MPEG-2.
We do not currently support Apple ProRes, ARRI and RED.

**Step 1:**

Go to Import & Upload, and click the "Upload from My Web Browser" button.

![Upload Videos]({{ site.url }}/assets/Uploading Videos to the Zype Platform from the Web/upload_web_browser.png)

**Step 2:**

By default, we automatically add the video to your library and we activate the video. If you would
like to change this, toggle Add Video or Activate Video off. Then, select the file that you want to upload.

![upload video]({{ site.url }}/assets/Uploading Videos to the Zype Platform from the Web/upload_video_options.png)

**Step 3:**

When the file is finished uploading, you will be redirected to the video's page where you
can add additional metadata. Once your video is finished [transcoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding), you will
be able to play your video and select your video thumbnail.

## Adding Videos from a YouTube Channel
We simplified the process of searching for and importing a YouTube Channel into the Zype Platform.
Before, you had to manually go to YouTube and find your Channel ID. This was a cumbersome
process. Now you can search for a YouTube Channel from the Zype Platform and we will get the Channel ID for you.

**Step 1:**

Go to Video Sources and click on the YouTube icon.

![click youtube]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a YouTube Channel to the Zype Platform/click_youtube.png)
**Step 2:**

Enter a name for your YouTube Video Source (something to help you remember it!) and click the
Search YouTube Channels button

![search youtube channels]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a YouTube Channel to the Zype Platform/search_youtube_channel.png)

**Step 3:**

Enter the channel name that you are searching for and click Search. You will be
given a list of YouTube Channels that match your search criteria. Click the Select Channel
button for the YouTube Channel that you want to add.

![click select channel]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a YouTube Channel to the Zype Platform/select_channel.png)

**Step 4:**

This will prepopulate the Channel ID for you. All you need to do is click Save Changes
and the Zype Platform will start to import all of the videos from the channel that you selected!

![click submit]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a YouTube Channel to the Zype Platform/youtube_save_changes.png)

**Step 5:**

Your imported videos are in your import videos page. You can add videos to your catalogue
from there.

![import videos]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a YouTube Channel to the Zype Platform/add_video.png)

## Adding Videos from a Vimeo Channel, Group or User
We're happy to provide you with a simple and powerful for importing your Vimeo videos to the Zype Platform. Below are the steps for grabbing your videos, no matter where they exist in Vimeo.

**Step 1:**

Go to Video Sources and click on the Vimeo icon.

![click vimeo]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a Vimeo Channel, Group or User/click_vimeo.png)

**Step 2:**

Enter a name for your Vimeo Video Source (something to help you remember it!).

**Step 3:**

You'll need to copy and paste a link to your Vimeo videos from a group, channel or user. Here are some quick example links:

<pre><code>https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks

https://vimeo.com/user36554072/videos

https://vimeo.com/groups/animation
</code></pre>

First, go to Vimeo and copy the link:

![copy your link]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a Vimeo Channel, Group or User/vimeo_copy.png)

Then paste the link into the Vimeo Source form:

![paste your link]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a Vimeo Channel, Group or User/paste_your_link.png)

Then click the 'Save Changes' button.


**Step 4:**

If everything went according to plan, you can see your new video imports by clicking on the green 'Video Imports' button.

## Adding Videos from a Vimeo PRO Account

We just added a brand new feature to our platform that lets you better distribute and  monetize your Vimeo content. Introducing Vimeo PRO for Zype!

Import all of your Vimeo PRO videos to the platform and stream them through the ad-supported Zype player. Here's how.

### Start by clicking the Vimeo PRO link on the [Import & Upload page](https://admin.zype.com/import_upload):

![video imports]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a Vimeo PRO Account/Zype___Import___Upload.png)

### Log in to your Vimeo PRO account:

![video imports]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a Vimeo PRO Account/Log_In.png)

### Allow Zype to have access to your videos:

![video imports]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a Vimeo PRO Account/Vimeo_Auth.png)

### Choose a custom name for this video source or simply click Import from Vimeo PRO:

![video imports]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Videos from a Vimeo PRO Account/Zype___New_Vimeo_PRO_Source.png)

If everything went according to plan, you should see a success message at the top of your screen and a link to your videos. It's just that easy.

HINT: Make sure to take full advantage of your player rules to determine whether your Vimeo PRO videos are streamed through the Vimeo player or the Zype player.

## Adding Your Crunchyroll Videos
We know you have a lot of video content and we know that you want it all to be available to your viewers through the Zype Platform. That's why we're proud to announce that you can now use [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/) as a video source for videos on the Zype Platform!

As part of the announcement, we want to walk you through the setup involved and get you up to speed. If you've added videos to the Zype Platform using video sources in the past, the will look very familiar.



### Navigating to the Crunchyroll Video Source form

First, let's login to the [Zype Platform](https://admin.zype.com/) and go to [Video Sources](https://admin.zype.com/video_sources). Now click on the Crunchyroll icon.

![click crunchyroll]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Your Crunchyroll Videos to Zype/click_crunchy.png)



### Adding your affiliate code

Enter a name for your Crunchyroll Video Source (something you'll remember!) and your Crunchyroll Affiliate code (this is provided to you by Crunchyroll when you become an affiliate.)

![add name and affiliate code]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Your Crunchyroll Videos to Zype/new_crunchy_source.png)



### Importing your videos

Now sit back while we go get all of your Crunchyroll videos and add them to the Zype Platform as video imports.
Once we've imported all of your videos you will find them under the [Video Imports](https://admin.zype.com/video_imports) tab. The last step is to create new videos from the imports or add the video imports to videos you already have on the Zype Platform.

![video imports]({{site.url}}assets/Adding Your Crunchyroll Videos to Zype/import_conformation.png)



### Confirm

You can confirm that your videos were added by clicking on the videos tab and searching for the ones you've just added.

## Uploading Videos to the Zype Platform Using Our Ruby Gem
We're rolling out a bunch of new ways to add video content to the Zype Platform, like [Youtube Channel Import](http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/11/18/search-youtube-in-zype/) and [Crunchyroll Video Import](http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/11/19/adding-crunchyroll-as-a-video-source/). In this post we'll show you how to use the Zype Command Line Interface (or CLI) to upload videos that you have stored on a harddrive.

### Downloading and Installing the Zype CLI

First, you'll need to download and set up the Zype CLI. You can find the tool on [gitHub](https://github.com/edla/zype-cli).

![gitHub]({{site.url}}assets/Uploading Videos to Zype Using Our Ruby Gem/copy_clone.png)

You'll need to clone down the repo, then run the following commands:

<pre><code>$ gem build zype.gemspec
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ gem install ./zype-1.0.0.gem
</code></pre>

You can confirm that your installation succeeded by entering

<pre><code>$ zype
</code></pre>

which will display a list of available commands for the Zype CLI. Remember this command in case you have questions about what the Zype CLI can do!

![CLI Interface]({{site.url}}assets/Uploading Videos to Zype Using Our Ruby Gem/commands.png)


### Logging in through the Zype CLI

Let's make sure that you can login and that your Zype CLI is linked to your instance of the Zype Platform.

Enter the command below:

<pre><code>$ zype account:login
</code></pre>

You'll be prompted to enter your Zype API Key. You can find this by logging in to the [Zype Platform](https://admin.zype.com) and clicking on API within the settings menu at the top of the screen. Grab your API key and enter it into the terminal to continue.

### Uploading your videos

You'll need to know which directory contains the videos you want to upload. Once you know where they live, you can run the upload command.

If all of the files live in a single directory, run the following command, replacing the example directory ("/myDir/videos") with your own.

<pre><code>$ zype video:upload --directory="/myDir/videos"
</code></pre>

If you have multiple subdirectories that contain videos, you can pass in a wildcard character (*) at the end of the parent directory to grab all of the videos within each subdirectory. Like this:

<pre><code>$ zype video:upload --directory="/myDir/videos/*"
</code></pre>

Now sit back while we upload all of your videos and add them to the Zype Platform as video imports. Once we've imported all of your videos you will find them under the [Video Imports](https://admin.zype.com/video_imports) tab. The last step is to create new videos from the imports or add the video imports to videos you already have on the Zype Platform.

![video imports]({{site.url}}assets/Uploading Videos to Zype Using Our Ruby Gem/imports.png)

### Confirm

You can confirm that your videos were added by clicking on the videos tab and searching for the ones you've just added.

to import. You can add additional metadata such as the title and the description. If
the "Add Video" button is toggled on, your Livestream.com video will automatically be
