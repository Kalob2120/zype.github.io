## Adding Videos from a YouTube Channel
We simplified the process of searching for and importing a YouTube Channel into the Zype Platform.
Before, you had to manually go to YouTube and find your Channel ID. This was a cumbersome
process. Now you can search for a YouTube Channel from the Zype Platform and we will get the Channel ID for you.

**Step 1:**

Go to Video Sources and click on the YouTube icon.

**Step 2:**

Enter a name for your YouTube Video Source (something to help you remember it!) and click the
Search YouTube Channels button

![search youtube channels](http://i.imgur.com/Ly24GBg.png)

**Step 3:**

Enter the channel name that you are searching for and click Search. You will be
given a list of YouTube Channels that match your search criteria. Click the Select Channel
button for the YouTube Channel that you want to add.

![click select channel](http://i.imgur.com/hpAfMu8.png)

**Step 4:**

This will prepopulate the Channel ID for you. All you need to do is click Save Changes
and the Zype Platform will start to import all of the videos from the channel that you selected!

**Step 5:**

Your imported videos are in your import videos page. You can add videos to your catalogue
from there.

## Adding Your Crunchyroll Videos
We know you have a lot of video content and we know that you want it all to be available to your viewers through the Zype Platform. That's why we're proud to announce that you can now use [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/) as a video source for videos on the Zype Platform!

As part of the announcement, we want to walk you through the setup involved and get you up to speed. If you've added videos to the Zype Platform using video sources in the past, the will look very familiar.



### Navigating to the Crunchyroll Video Source form

First, let's login to the [Zype Platform](https://admin.zype.com/) and go to [Video Sources](https://admin.zype.com/video_sources). Now click on the Crunchyroll icon.

![click crunchyroll](http://i.imgur.com/oSJebB6.png)



### Adding your affiliate code

Enter a name for your Crunchyroll Video Source (something you'll remember!) and your Crunchyroll Affiliate code (this is provided to you by Crunchyroll when you become an affiliate.)

![add name and affiliate code](http://i.imgur.com/tPG2uZv.png)



### Importing your videos

Now sit back while we go get all of your Crunchyroll videos and add them to the Zype Platform as video imports.
Once we've imported all of your videos you will find them under the [Video Imports](https://admin.zype.com/video_imports) tab. The last step is to create new videos from the imports or add the video imports to videos you already have on the Zype Platform.

### Confirm

You can confirm that your videos were added by clicking on the videos tab and searching for the ones you've just added.

## Uploading Videos to the Zype Platform Using Our Ruby Gem
We're rolling out a bunch of new ways to add video content to the Zype Platform, like [Youtube Channel Import](http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/11/18/search-youtube-in-zype/) and [Crunchyroll Video Import](http://dev.zype.com/posts/2014/11/19/adding-crunchyroll-as-a-video-source/). In this post we'll show you how to use the Zype Command Line Interface (or CLI) to upload videos that you have stored on a harddrive.

### Downloading and Installing the Zype CLI

First, you'll need to download and set up the Zype CLI. You can find the tool on [gitHub](https://github.com/edla/zype-cli).

![gitHub](http://i.imgur.com/ZC3mLEs.png)

You'll need to clone down the repo, then run the following commands:

<pre><code>$ gem build zype.gemspec
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ gem install ./zype-1.0.0.gem
</code></pre>

You can confirm that your installation succeeded by entering

<pre><code>$ zype
</code></pre>

which will display a list of available commands for the Zype CLI. Remember this command in case you have questions about what the Zype CLI can do!

### Logging in through the Zype CLI

Let's make sure that you can login and that your Zype CLI is linked to your instance of the Zype Platform.

Enter the command below:

<pre><code>$ zype account:login
</code></pre>

You'll be prompted to enter your Zype API Key. You can find this by logging in to the [Zype Platform](https://admin.zype.com) and clicking on API within the settings menu at the top of the screen. Grab your API key and enter it into the terminal to continue.

### Uploading your videos

You'll need to know which directory contains the videos you want to upload. Once you know where they live, you can run the upload command.

If all of the files live in a single directory, run the following command, replacing the example directory ("/myDir/videos") with your own.

<pre><code>$ zype video:upload --directory="/myDir/videos"
</code></pre>

If you have multiple subdirectories that contain videos, you can pass in a wildcard character (*) at the end of the parent directory to grab all of the videos within each subdirectory. Like this:

<pre><code>$ zype video:upload --directory="/myDir/videos/*"
</code></pre>

Now sit back while we upload all of your videos and add them to the Zype Platform as video imports. Once we've imported all of your videos you will find them under the [Video Imports](https://admin.zype.com/video_imports) tab. The last step is to create new videos from the imports or add the video imports to videos you already have on the Zype Platform.

![video imports](http://i.imgur.com/SrnGXnw.png)

### Confirm

You can confirm that your videos were added by clicking on the videos tab and searching for the ones you've just added.

## Adding YouTube Video from a URL
We're happy to announce that the [Zype Platform](http://admin.zype.com) now grants you the power to import videos from YouTube simply by copying an pasting a YouTube link into the platform.

Check out the [Video Imports Screen](http://admin.zype.com/video_imports) and click on the "Add a YouTube Video Import" button to get started.

The next step is to copy a URL from YouTube that shows the video you want to add.


![copy url](http://i.imgur.com/QdHp2nM.png)


Paste the URL into the field on this page and click "Add Video Import".

If everything went according to plan, you should see the video imports screen again, with a new import from the link you provided.
