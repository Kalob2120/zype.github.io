## Consumers
Consumers are the backbone of Zype's Subscription Service. Consumers, with a plan,
create a subscription. The Zype Platform supports Stripe for credit card processing of consumers.

## Connecting Stripe
Before creating a consumer, you will need to link your Stripe Account to the Zype Platform.
In the Zype Platform, navigate to settings and enter your Stripe Secret Key. Your Stripe Secret Key can be found under your Stripe [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys).
