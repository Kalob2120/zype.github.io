##All About Consumers
The Zype Platform is feature rich, so we want to provide you with a place to learn more about it.
Below are a bunch of short tutorials (with pictures!) to help you with videos.

## Connecting Stripe
Before creating a consumer, you need to link your Stripe Account to the Zype Platform.
To link your Stripe Account, navigate in the Zype Platform to settings and enter your
Stripe Secret Key. Your Stripe Secret Key can be found under your Stripe [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys).

## Creating a  (DPT)
Zypeâ€™s DPT allows you to create player rules based on geography and device.
For example, you could declare that end users will receive the Hulu Player if he
or she is accessing your video via desktop in the United States or the Zype Player
if he or she is accessing your video via desktop in Australia.
