        <p>One of the biggest strengths of the Zype Platfom is its ability to distribute your
video content on multiple platforms like Roku. In this tutorial, we will describe how to use
the Zype Platform to create a Roku app that looks like the screen shot below.</p>

        <p>We simplified the process of searching for and importing a YouTube Channel into the Zype Platform.
Before, you had to manually go to YouTube and find your Channel ID. This was a cumbersome
process. Now you can search for a YouTube Channel from the Zype Platform and we will get the Channel ID for you.</p>

        <p>To import a YouTube Channel into the Zype Platform, you need to have its Channel ID.
This ID can be tricky to find because the Channel ID and User ID are very similar.
Below are the options and steps to finding a YouTube Channel ID
to input into the Zype Platform.</p>

        <p>While developing, we always keep the user experience in mind and one of the most important things for a content heavy application
is load times. In rails, this usually comes down to how quickly you can render the requested view. Today I want to take a quick look
at how to nest caching statements in rails 4 for maximum effectiveness.</p>

additional content based on what your users are watching. The solution we&#8217;ve implemented is called related videos.
In this post, we&#8217;ll be covering how to create a playlist of related videos that are recommended to a viewer
based on what the video they&#8217;re watching. Here&#8217;s an example of the finished product:</p>

        <p>In a previous post, we covered how to use Zype’s Dynamic Player Technology (DPT).
In this post, we’ll be covering how to use the DPT logs to see what requests are being made for your video content.
For example, let’s say you’ve uploaded a batch of new videos and after the first 30 days, you’d like to get an idea
of who’s viewing your content and what times of the day are most popular for viewing.</p>

        <p>Zype’s DPT allows you to create player rules based on geography and device.
For example, you could declare that end users will receive the Hulu Player if he
or she is accessing your video via desktop in the United States or the Zype Player
if he or she is accessing your video via desktop in Australia.</p>

      <p>
        <p>To organize your playlists using the Zype Platform, you can assign categories to
your playlists and filter your playlists based on a category and its value.
In this tutorial, I will walk through how to query for all the playlists that have
a category named ‘zone’ and a value of ‘home.’ At Zype, we use this
strategy to get all the playlists that we want to be displayed on the home page or zone.</p>
