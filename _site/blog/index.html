        <p>Adding image assets to your Roku Channel allow your to make the channel your own!
Using the Zype Platform and Zype API, you will be able to change the majority of
images on the fly without having to republish your app. However, there are a few images
that need to be bundled during installation because they make up your
application icon set. These images live on the Roku Channel store.
This tutorial will describe the images that need to be bundled, the images that can
be updated via the Zype Platform, and the details of both.</p>

In this tutorial, we will walk through how to publish a Private Roku Channel that you can
share immediately with anyone that owns a Roku. If you are interested in publishing a Public Roku Channel, the steps are very similar, just you have to wait for Roku to approve your channel before it can be accessed in the Roku Channel Store. It is recommended that you first publish a private channel, test the channel out to beta users, and then publish the channel publicly.</p>

of whoâs viewing your content and what times of the day are most popular for viewing.</p>

if he or she is accessing your video via desktop in Australia.</p>
